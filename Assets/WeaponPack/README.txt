Thank you for Purchasing this pack.

    Note that credit is appreciated when this pack is used in your projects, but it is not required.

    If you need any help with this asset, please email us directly @:     dldooms@eagles.usi.edu

Particle systems do not come with this pack. You will have to purchase those separately once they have been released to the
asset store. If they are not released at the time you are reading this, please feel free to "bump" the developer email above.

We will also be happy to provide custom assets. Note that custom purchases are based on the pack that would be
released to the asset store. If you would like something more complicated than our assets provide, we may be able
to work something out. Again, use the developer email above.

If you are interested in seeing more or watching us develop these assets live, feel free to follow our twitter, twitch, and
other social media sites!
